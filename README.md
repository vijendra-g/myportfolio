## Welcome To My Portfolio

I am an amateur [artist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artist) from California. My skills mainly fall into 2d digital and analog art.

I will post here often so please come back to check out my art!

### My Pieces: 

I've made a lot of pieces but for now I am going to include 2 copyright free stock images so I can get a grade for my Computer Science Project.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/vijendra-g/myportfolio/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
