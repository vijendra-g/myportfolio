## Welcome To My Portfolio

I am an amateur [artist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artist) from California. My skills mainly fall into 2d digital and analog art.

I will post here often so please come back to check out my art!

### My Pieces: 

I've made a lot of pieces but for now I am going to include 2 copyright free clip art images so I can get a grade for my Computer Science Project.
